# NooBaby
NoobV2 is a refactored version.  



## To Run NooBaby
Noob_Main.py starts the program.
NoobV2 is the same program, but code has been refactored into multiple files. 
Noob_Main_V2.py runs the 2nd version.

You MUST create a profile to access the app. There is an option to skip the username / password page. It uses a test account to access the app.  It may not work on another computer.

Requires installation of Custom Tkinter in order to view the GUI. More info here : https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter

To install, use : pip3 install customtkinter
Also uses : tkCalender and sqlite3. I don't think they need to be installed.

This is a work in progress. As such, not all features are working or in their final form.
